# SlowLoris
SlowLoris ddos attack implementation

Running the program:

Every child computer from the botnet should run: "python zombie.py clientIp"

When the zombie scripts are executing you can run: "python client.py"

On the client use this command to start the attack: "slowloris targetIpAddress numberOfSockets"

This type of ddos only works in apache servers running on Windows
